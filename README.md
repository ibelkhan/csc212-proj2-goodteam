Components (original hopefuls):
==================================



Actual Design:

1. Front-end list for seminars;
2. Back-end SQL setting for adding and editing seminars;
3. Add calendar;
4. Add calendar setting button; limitations: cannot add to calendar locally;
5. Add image map, information per seminar;


What It Can Do:

This website's main feature is a table of upcoming seminars that are available to students. 
Each entry in the table shows the seminar's date, time, speaker, department, a description of the lecture,
the food that will be provided, and the location of the lecture. Lectures that have already happened are 
removed from the table. The site also allows users to add new lectures to the main table. Lastly, the site
allows users to choose a lecture, add it to his or her google calander, view the location of the lecture on
a map, and view the occupancy of the venue, the rating of the speaker, the subject popularity, and the 
estimated attendance. This information gives users enough details to decide exactly which lectures will be 
worth their time, given their individual desires.
