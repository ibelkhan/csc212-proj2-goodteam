What Is It?:
==================================
This webpage's primary feature is to function as an aggregator for upcoming academic talks at the University of Rochester available for students and faculty. Each entry in the table documents a seminar's date, time, speaker, department, lecture topic, food provided, and location. Lectures that have already occured are automatically removed from the table. The site also permits users to add new lectures to the main table. Additionally, the site allows users to choose lectures, add them to their respective google calanders, view the location of the lecture on an integrated map, view the occupancy of the venue, the rating of the speaker, the subject popularity, and the estimated attendance. This information gives users enough details to decide exactly which lectures will be worth their time, given their individual desires.
