5. Add image map, information per seminar;


What It Can Do:
==================================

This webpage's primary feature is to function as an aggregator for upcoming academic talks at the University of Rochester
available for students and faculty.Each entry in the table documents a seminar's date, time, speaker, department, lecture 
topic, food provided, and location. Lectures that have already occured are automatically removed from the table. The site
also permits users to add new lectures to the main table. Lastly, the site allows users to choose lectures, 
add them to his or her google calander, view the location of the lecture on a map, and view the occupancy of the venue,
the rating of the speaker, the subject popularity, and the estimated attendance. This information gives users enough
details to decide exactly which lectures will be worth their time, given their individual desires.
